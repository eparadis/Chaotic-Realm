# Notes (by edp)

In this fork I deleted everything other than the ADBDuino project, since that's all I care about.

I preserved Difegue's original notes below.

I created my own version of the project he describes on his blog and have been using it
successfully for many years now. I had made some adjustments to his code but I have seemed to
have lost those at some point. So from here out changes will be pushed here.


# Original README by [Difegue](https://github.com/Difegue)

This is a modified version of [bbraun's](http://synack.net/svn/adbduino/) [archive.org copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20200704022511/http://synack.net/svn/adbduino/)  PS/2 to ADB arduino sketch,  
with some extra code added to alleviate issues with my own PS/2 keyboard.
